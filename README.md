Ever wondered if your favorite band's lead singer secretly collects Nazi memorabilia? Or if that cool black metal group you just discovered has a history of sacrificing small animals on stage? Look no further! This web app is your one-stop shop for uncovering the dirty laundry of the music world. We're here to help you decide whether to cancel your concert tickets or just embrace the chaos.

I have created it just to test how to make a quick search application with static data from a JSON file using Astro, Tailwind and components from ShadCN.   

## Features

- Search functionality to quickly find information about specific artists
- Color-coded results indicating the level of concern (SAFE, QUESTIONABLE, SKETCH, NAZI)
- Detailed explanations and sources (when available) for each artist
- Form to send new suggestions
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use

## Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static Site Generator
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI Components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type Safety

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser
